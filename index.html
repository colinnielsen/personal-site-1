        <h1>Dr. Strangecode or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Process</h1>
        <h2>A reflection on my learning experience at Galvanize</h2>
        <p>Feb 27, 2018</p>

        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>
        <p>
          For this project I set the stage dividing my work space into 2/3 1/3 with atom and firefox and made sure my notifications were off! Here's a vid https://youtu.be/pQLbhPaG9kU
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I began Galvanize chomping at the bit really just ready to learn and soak in absolutely all that I could. Last week began well as we all worked quickly through cli drills and were, for the most part, at the same level of knowledge. By the end
          of the week I already felt myself falling behind in comparison to the rest of my classmates. So naturally, the stress set in, followed by harsh self-analysis and frustration. I worked hard to catch-up, and if I'm honest, I was working fast,
          not to necessarily learn any of the complicated content. All of   this "work" peaked for me this Monday. I worked so hard at CSS to format my first page - and by hard I mean to literally throw my head over and over again into the problem. Today
          is when I decided to change the way I was approaching the course and how to learn. I decided that I needed to prioritize process over product and see what I could learn...and it went great!
            <br><br>
          Today was my most productive day. It left me with a sense of accomplishment with brainpower still left to spare at the end of the day. I definitely was open to more information using a slower, more methodical pacing to my SMART goal
          day plan.
            <br><br>
          One thing that helped me the most today, especially in learning more CSS, was to play with the code. After a very constructive breakout with Brooks, I came back to working on my website with the devtools on Firefox. This helped me really
          play around with the css right in the console and to get a deeper understanding of what values I could use and how my webpage is set up.
          <br><br>
          In summation, today I learned to work smarter, not harder.

        <h1>Javascript Learn to Learn</h1>
        <p>March 10th, 2018</p>
        <h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
        <p>
          To set the stage I used repl.it a lot. I also was using a lot of google and MDN to check through how JS worked. I had repl in chrome on one half of my screen and the Js funamentals in atom in the other. This helped me go back and forth between
          environments to test changes and mess around with the code.
        </p>

        <h2>Play</h2>
        <p>
          Repl helped me play a lot with JavaScript to learn how it read imputs etc. I would set up a bunch of variables and little functions and then console log them and return them to see what would print and what wouldn't. I'm also using the fundamental
          practices to mess around with little functions and problems before I end up moving onto the bigger stuff.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, I've been struggling with understanding Javascript. Ive been trying to really understand the logic behind how it works and why it does things, and honestly, it's been very difficult. I've struggled being in the right mindset to think
          logicly and structurally. With JS, it seems I need a lot more brainpower to work foward in learning.
          <br><br>
          The last day or so i've had a lot of success with starting at the fundamental practices and working from there. The fundamentals start out super easy and they have given me a good foundation and most importantly, a sense of accomplishment
          every couple minutes. One of the hardest parts for me about diving in on a really hard problem is sometimes it just feels like you're at it for days without any boost or sense of completion. This is definintely really discouraging to me but
          i've been finding a lot of ego boost in being able to nail these small bite size drills.
          <br><br>
          In the future, I'm definitely going to use these drills a lot while im learning really difficult new topics

        <h1>Learning DOM Manipulation</h1>
        <p>March 19, 2018</p>

        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>
        <p>
          To set the stage to learn DOM, I set myself upstairs next to Brevan, who I knew had a lot of knowledge of how the DOM worked and whenever I got blocked he could give me good advice. I also started using a study interval timer to do 25 min on,
          5 min off intervals throughout the day.
        </p>

        <h2>Play</h2>
        <p>
          To play with this stuff, I used console.log consistiently to be able to track what the program was doing step by step. It was also just fun to implement some DOM manipulation onto my P1 site to try to make it function more like an app on a single
          page.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Today went really well. I learned a lot about DOM, especailly how document.get works to pull elements into js. Because I was console logging everything, I found it pretty easy to navigate and edit the arrays I was getting back to change elememnts
          on the page. Sitting next to Brevan helped quite a bit as well. Whenever I had blockers he helped me sort through them really quickly by helping explain what was going on. Lastly, working on my personal site really helped me get excited about
          the DOM and made it a lot more interesting to me. I got to see the more practical side of the DOM and how to move, show, or hide divs to reveal content.
          <br><br>
          Overall, I feel really satisified with what I know about the DOM and I feel confident about how it's implemented and used consistently

        <h1>Smart goals - Monday</h1>
        <h2>
          Stretch - complete two exercises!, Really nail how your css looks and be proud of it.
        </h2>
        <p>
          -Finish the intro to css and html sections by spending the first 2 hours before lunch hammering out drills and trying to gain familiarity with the content. Needs to be done by 5:00 p.m all clean and tidy!
        </p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <p>Ask Dylan for help if need be, he's already completed them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            work on a learn to learn article in your break times. Take as many as 3 breaks and be able to get one whole blog post complete.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Today I failed miserably at these goals. I attempted to finish two CSS drills and didn’t even get through the first one. Today left me really frustrated and i definitely felt defeated. I did a good job asking other people for help with my code
          when i got stuck for more than 10 minutes and really enjoyed dialoguing about the code I was making. I also did stick to my timeline really well and ended up ‘hammering’ out code for those first two ours. However, that was also my biggest problem.
          I tried my best to just “hammer” through it instead of actually learn. Tomorrow, I will definitely focus more on the learning aspect of playing with my code.

        <h1>Smart goals -Tuesday</h1>

        <h2>Stretch</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tighten up my css have the the first drill completely finished by the end of the day. Dabble in some JS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Go to JS breakout and then go to lunch. Just absorb what you learn, no stress, no stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          By 2p.m have 2 learn to learn drills done. When you come back from lunch, read through the l2l ruberics
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to flex box breakout
        </li>
        <li>
          Come back and brush up on my flex box. Play some FlexBox froggy and mess around with colored divs in Atom...just see how code stacks and understand more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with Reed on css drill. Don’t try to white knuckle it, take time, use a timer, take breaks. Determine at 3 if i can get everything done while still retaining information and just really focus on learning mostly!
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Reflection: Today went much better! I completed all my stretch goals. I feel more versed in flex box, I get a bit more JavaScript, and I finished my css website. The best thing I think I did today was work at a slow, patient pace. I wasn’t trying to just blast through lessons anymore and because of that the content I was learning became significantly more engaging. I didn’t get the chance to do the two learn to learn drills, but i did read all of the learn to learn content and dabbled in the coursera content too. Overall today I felt my goals were much more realistic, and even though it seemed like my goals weren’t as ambitious, I got a ton more done than I did yesterday! Tomorrow I’m going to continue learning and training like this, it worked out really well :)

        <h1>Smart Goals - Wednesday</h1>

        <h2>Stretch - Get css drill 2 complete</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            write a reflection for l2l and for smart goals. Use your break time to work on the soft-skills and recharge. Reflect on how the day is	going in this time.
          </li>
          <li>
            research on WebGL in prep for meetup tonight. Kyle said just to use Wiki to look up what it is, what frameworks integrate well with it, a bit about ember, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            fix all cli drills. Watch what Slackbot said about specifics...and look at the ruberic!
          </li>
          <li>
            play with some JS functions on repl. Open some of the repl projects we got in the JS accelerated course and move pieces of the functions around. Just play with it and figure out how it works.
          </li>
          <li>
            look into firebase. See what these drills are all about if you have the extra time. No need to complete them, just look them over a bit and get familiar.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Reflection: Today I did really well. I had a solid pace all day and was motivated and focused. I didn’t do anything for learn to learn, but I researched, fixed a cli drill. played with JS, did all my firebase drills and finished my stretch goals! Today felt very reasonable in terms of what i set out to do, and this gave me a lot of motivation and drive. I feel on this third time I really nailed good goal setting. If all my days here at Galvanize could go like this, I think i would be in a great place! One reason I felt it worked well was because I took breaks whenever i felt brain fog set in, or lack of motivation. This made me feel a lot less exhausted. Tomorrow I’m definitely going to try and replicate this tomorrow and for next week!

        <h1>WebGL and threeJS in Ember</h1>

        <h2>People I Met</h2>
        <p>
          I met a great guy named Frankie - he is the owner of a development consulting agency called Cirro. Met someone else named Alex - he works up in boulder as an ember developer!
        </p>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          I watched a demonstration on how to set up a scene in threeJS and a whole bunch of threeJS examples. it was really interesting for me to get insight into what I really want to end up doing as a web dev. I really want to get into making animations in the the next couple months and be able to make some beautifully immersive pages and apps. I learned a few performance knowledge about in browser rendering. for instance, graphically intense renders are done on the user's CPU, meaning that you dont have to worry about any bottlenecks from the serverside or from the framework.
          <br><br>
          Because of this meetup, i'm seriously considering using ember as my framework of choice once we get to bucket 2.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How do you put a threeJS scene into a framework like A-frame for webVR?
          </li>
          <li>
            Whats the best way to get started with Ember?
          </li>
          <li>
            How do you make geometric looking renders of say - waves in an ocean?
          </li>

        <h1>Front Range Front-End Meetup</h1>
        <p>CSS Basics - Selectors</p>
        <h2>People I Met</h2>
        <p>
           - I had the chance to introduce myself to the Organizer of the group named James. He is a UX Dev for a company called DockYard ran out of Boston. He works a lot with SASS and is basically a master of all things css. - jdsteinbach@gmail.com - https://github.com/jdsteinbach
        </p>

        <p>
          I also met a guy named Jin. He just started at GA on the 3 month web development course. He also works as a server at Acorn. Seemed like a neat guy. - https://www.meetup.com/front-range-front-end/members/242638017/
        </p>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>I watched James do a two hour slideshow on different types of selectors and how scope and specificity work in CSS. I understood a lot more about the innards of CSS and how it works. I learned about :hover , :focus , attribue selectors , and combining selectors. What was most interesting to me was parent and child classes, and selectors like nth-child. He also showed us this image, which I grabbed to saved for later - http://www.standardista.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/specificityimg.png
          <br><br>
        Overall it was really helpful to see an expert program in css and use flow and selectors to make good, clean code.
        </p>
        <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How can you animate in CSS?</li>
          <li>What are the most efficient selectors to use in basic pages?</li>
          <li>How does positioning work in css?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Smart Cities & Open Data</h1>
        <h2>People I Met</h2>
         <p>
           - Demetri - He works in digital marketing at a company called Professional Advantage. - https://www.linkedin.com/in/demetriosdemetriou/
         </p>
         <p>
           Andrew - He's a full stack dev who works mostly with Python and JS. - https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-kolansky-58031472/
         </p>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          The talk was on the proliferation of smart cities and how tech is being integrated into city life. We had a speaker who was a counselwoman for Westminster where they've actually been pioneering a lot of different technologies like smart light poles and smart crosswalks. We also talked a lot about city planning and archetecture fields utalizing augmented reality technologies, which I found especially interesting. The speakers talked on the specific applications of integrating the "internet of things" into the citizen's environment to promote safety, ease of use, or community participation. I learned a lot about the future of Denver and tech, and also about data.gov from the second speaker who was a leader of the Colorado Smart Cities Alliance. Data.gov is a transparency project hosted by the US government that publicizes data it collects about things like climate, public health, or education. Cities also push their data --anything from traffic stats and live-update bus locations to pot-hole repair times-- to the public domain for us all to access.
            <br><br>
          I asked some questions about how open data could be implement in mobile or web apps for citizens and the speaker said he sees a future coming very soon where start-ups work with state and local government to push technology into the citysphere.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>What are some companies in Denver working doing software / data engineering utalizing open data?</li>
          <li>What are some more practical applications of the government's open data working with the tech market?</li>
          <li>How do you think that augmented reality technology could affect the average citizen's life in 5-7 years?</li>
        </ul>
